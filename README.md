# Wordle util

This is a small web app to analyze your wordle play. I made this because I suck at wordle and wanted to know how many valid words were left and because I don't want to brute-force the remaining valid word if it is something like "myrrh".

This project was also a good excuse to use a framework I haven't used before.

The valid word list is extracted from Wordle and sorted alphabetically.
